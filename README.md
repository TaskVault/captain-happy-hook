# 🪝 Captain Happy Hook

With Captain Happy Hook we tried to solve the price impact problem that afflicts every defi user, especially smaller ones. We created a Uniswap hook for v4 pools that reorders incoming swap transaction in a smart way and guarantees a more fair price for every participant.

## Hackathon bounties

- Uniswap Foundation: Captain Happy Hook leverages the new hook functionality created for Uniswap v4, in particular the beforeSwap is used to register incoming transactions and store them with the purpose of reordering them in a second moment.
